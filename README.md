# LLM Quality Evaluation Examples for K–12  
Created by **Lauren Kilefner** (`lkilefner`)

Hi there! I’m Lauren — a K–12 math and robotics teacher who believes that **educators are the magic**, and that AI should *support* great teaching, not replace it. This repo shows how I evaluate AI-generated responses for clarity, accuracy, tone, developmental appropriateness, and usefulness for real students and teachers.

This is the same lens I use in the classroom:
- Does the explanation *make sense* to the learner?
- Is the tone supportive and confidence-building?
- Are the steps clear and free of unnecessary complexity?
- Will this help a student move forward?

### What this repo includes
| Folder | What’s Inside | Why it Matters |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **/prompts** | Sample K–12 academic + feedback prompts with *ground truth* exemplar answers | Demonstrates how I define correctness and clarity |
| **/rubrics** | A simple scoring rubric for evaluating AI responses | Shows I can evaluate consistently and transparently |
| **/datasets** | Small JSON + CSV datasets used for scoring practice | Reflects readiness for LLM testing workflows |
| **/dashboards** | Notes on how I would visualize and track evaluation results | Shows how I think about patterns & quality over time |

### My Evaluation Priorities
When reviewing LLM outputs, I look for:

1. **Accuracy** — Is the content correct?
2. **Alignment** — Does the response follow the prompt and grade level?
3. **Clarity & Cognitive Load** — Is the language simple and structured?
4. **Tone** — Does the response encourage and support the learner?
5. **Actionability** — Can a student or teacher *use* this to learn or improve?

In other words:  
**The explanation should feel like something I’d proudly hand to my own students.**

### Why I Created This
LLMs are incredibly powerful, but great teaching is personal, kind, and thoughtful. The work here reflects how I help ensure that **AI explanations are not just correct, but also *human*, supportive, and age-appropriate.**

### About Me
- Former accelerated math teacher & robotics instructor  
- Curriculum designer & instructional leader  
- Passionate about making learning feel **possible** for every student  
- Excited about how AI can reduce teacher overload and expand student support
