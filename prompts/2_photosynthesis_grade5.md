# Prompt 02 — Photosynthesis (Grade 5)

**User Prompt**  
“Explain photosynthesis to a 5th grader in 5–7 sentences. Include sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, and end with a one-sentence summary.”

**Ground Truth (Exemplar)**  
“Plants make their own food in a process called photosynthesis. They use **sunlight** for energy, take in **carbon dioxide** from the air, and absorb **water** through their roots. Inside their leaves, the plant uses these ingredients to create **sugar**, which is the food that helps it grow. During this process, the plant also releases **oxygen** back into the air, which is helpful for humans and animals. Most of this happens in the leaves, where the plant can catch the most sunlight. Without photosynthesis, plants wouldn’t have the energy they need to live.  
**Summary:** Plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make food and release oxygen as a byproduct.

**What Success Looks Like**  
- All four key components are included (sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, oxygen)  
- Sentences are **clear, calm, and easy to follow**  
- Jargon is kept to a minimum (optional mention of leaves is fine)  
- The explanation stays **focused on the main idea**  
- The final sentence is a **simple, one-sentence summary**

**What to Watch For** (Common Pitfalls)  
- Introducing too much detail too soon (ex: chloroplasts, chemical names)  
- Using long, dense sentences that are hard to follow  
- Forgetting to explain **why** the plant does this (to make food/energy)  
- Leaving out the release of oxygen  

**Why This Matters**  
Photosynthesis is one of the first times students see how living things use **energy**. Keeping the explanation **visual, simple, and steady** helps students understand the big idea before diving into scientific vocabulary later.
