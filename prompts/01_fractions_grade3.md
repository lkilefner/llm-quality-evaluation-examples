# Prompt 01 — Fractions (Grade 3)

**User Prompt**  
“Explain fractions to a 3rd grader using a pizza example, in 4–6 short sentences. Avoid jargon and keep it friendly.”

**Ground Truth (Exemplar)**  
“Imagine a pizza cut into 8 equal slices. If you eat 3 slices, you ate **3 out of 8** slices, which we write as **3/8**. The top number (3) tells how many slices you have. The bottom number (8) tells how many slices the whole pizza had to start with. Fractions show how much of something you have when it’s been divided into equal parts.”

**What Success Looks Like**  
- Uses a **clear and familiar real-life example** (pizza)  
- Stays at a **3rd-grade language level**  
- Keeps sentences **short and friendly**  
- Emphasizes **equal-sized parts**  
- Explains the meaning of the **two numbers in the fraction**  

**What to Watch For** (Common Pitfalls)  
- Forgetting to mention that the parts must be **equal**  
- Using vocabulary that’s too advanced (ex: numerator/denominator)  
- Giving a long paragraph instead of short, simple sentences  
- Confusing which number represents the “whole” vs. the “part”  

**Why This Matters**  
Fractions feel tricky when students first encounter them, especially if the explanation gets too abstract. A concrete image (like pizza or pie) makes the idea **visible and relatable**, helping students build confidence before moving to symbols or procedures.
